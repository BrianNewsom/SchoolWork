	Purpose: Final Game project for CSCI-2400 with Gabe Johnson
				At CU Boulder Spring Semester 2013

	Description: This is the classic hangman game. One user enters
	the word which they would like their friend to be guessing and
	for the rest of the game the friend tries to guess one character
	at a time until he has won
