# MUEL 4121 - Special Topics in Music Technology: Supercollider

This is a course I took in the Spring of 2013 discussing the digital signal processing / audio interfacing language supercollider. The syllabus is available in this repo [here](4121syllabus13.pdf). 
If you are interested, you can download and read more about Supercollider at http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

My final project for the course was a fully responsive drum sequencer with a GUI written completely in the language; check it out!
